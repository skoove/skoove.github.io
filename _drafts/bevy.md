[Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) is awesome, but I am probably not going to continue using it for most of my
projects.

## what was i using it for
I was using bevy for a 'simple' [n-body](https://github.com/skoove/n-body/) simulation (it's still simple-ish but I got carried away). I chose bevy as I thought it would be a simple choice that would give me tons of options to visualize and be fairly easy to use, and it was! However I don't think it is the best choice for what I am doing.
