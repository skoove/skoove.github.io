This week I mostly focused on org, because I have not had too much time to spend on programming stuff. I really like org!

# org
Org has been *extremely* nice to work with. I have been using it all week for school notes, transferring some relevent obsidian notes over (this counts as revision, I think). I have also been using it to keep track of notes for these blog posts! I really like that I can make nearly *anything* a todo item, including:

- headlines
- ordered lists
- unordered lists
- probably 10 more things I don't know about yet because I have not needed them

A nice example is that I am studying Macbeth for school, and we are given questions to prove that we have read the book, I made every question, act and scene a TODO item so that I could track how many I had left, both broadly and per scene. It was also really nice to be able to schedule each act so that I have a clear layout for work in the coming days with agenda, I did not know scheduled todo items that are pulled from all my notes was something I was missing, but I don't think I can go without it anymore.
