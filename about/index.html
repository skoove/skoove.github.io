<p>hi! im skoove!</p>
<p>I am a 17 year old living in Australia, I enjoy programming and 3d art, but I'm not particularly good either. I also love radio and aviation!</p>
<p>I use nixos (btw (nix fixes that)).</p>
<p>I started programming at a very young age, stumbling my way though a book about using <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Learn-Program-Minecraft-Craig-Richardson/dp/1593276702">python in minecraft</a>. I don't know if I learned more than that you can make computers do whatever you want if you know enough from this book, but it was fun. I then ended up doing things in scratch for a while, but never made anything of interest. I eventually got an Arduino kit, and much of my early programming knowledge came from that, as well as picking up python to make a few small projects. I now program mostly in rust.</p>
<p>Blender has been an on and off (currently off as of 2025-05-25) thing for me
for years now, I will pick it up, get halfway through the donut tutorial, loose
motivation and then give up. I then discovered how much you can do with geometry
nodes and shader nodes, but even then I knew nothing about how to make anything
look good, and lost interest again. This and a lot of watching YouTube lead me
to have a pretty good understanding of blenders UI and workflow, but nothing
that I could use to make things, I have now started using all of this knowledge
to make things that I at least think look kind of neat.</p>
